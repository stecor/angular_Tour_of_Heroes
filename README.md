# angular_Tour_of_Heroes

The Tour of Heroes app covers the core fundamentals of Angular. 
It's a basic app that has many of the features that expect to find in a full-blown, 
data-driven app: acquiring and displaying a list of heroes, 
editing a selected hero's detail, and navigating among different views of heroic data.
